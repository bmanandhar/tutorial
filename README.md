Not a secret that life will not be possible without web application. This is the theme that I followed from the days when I was a college student and started dreaming of becoming a web developer. Another fact That I know from my childhood is that a dream will remain a dream if one does not work hard to achieve it. What I am today is a result of my dream and my hard work. I never leave any stone unturned when I want or need to learn anything. Knowing that programming languages are the stepping stones to becoming a web developer, I learned those languages on my own besides formal academic learning at schools. I never left technology behind when I knew that it is required in developing a web application. And it is a worldly truth that learning never ends until the final moment of life because man is the only creature who never stops inventing technology. 

I am sure with the knowledge that I am equipped with, any company that hires me will definitely get the fruit. I am just looking to find a place where I can really make use of the skills that I have. Knowing the background and mission of Agrio, I am sure this is the right company for me to work as a developer and show the power that I keep in the field of software.'

Summary:> `I am confident working as a full-stack web developer with the talents and skills that I have and I am always ready to learn new skills that any job will require in addition in future. In the past, I have worked in groups on many occasions and always that I always enjoyed. 

I joined the immersive full-stack web developer immersive course after learning the different programming languages and technologies and graduated just recently. Hence I can work with a fresh spirit to utilize the knowledge that I earned. I am always open to any consultation if the employers need. 

I will also assure the employers that I if the job requires traveling abroad I am a perfect fit because I do have experiences traveling in different countries in a group or solo as a personal visit and business trip. On top of the skills that I have as a full-stack web developer, I am fluent in speaking several languages besides English. 

Please feel free to reach me if there is anything that you want to know about me.`

Chess:> `https://www.slideshare.net/MirOmranudinAbhar/chess-game-90002347`
=
Chess is the game that I always liked, next being the Bridge. It has been always a popular game, belived to have begun from India approximately 1500 years ago then propogated to all over the world. One of the reasons why it's all time popular is because it can be afforded by any level of population economically or age wise. In the begining Chess had been the game played by the elite group of people like eperors. Gradually it became popular among all. I like it because it is open informed game played between two players. The oponents always know about the status and strategy of the move that the other player might take. History not too old, the World Chess Championship between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky has the record

Here:

I am the best for this position because I know the method of teaching and techniques of curriculum development. I am sure I can use the skills I have if given a chance.

Sometimes somewhere I read a quotation “Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle cannot be shortened”. This is what I always follow in my profession as a teacher. I was totally satisfied when I successfully helped students to return to work at the institutions where I worked as a tutor. Likewise, the parents of my students whom I tutored math were so glad for me when their kids passed the High School Exams.  

As a result of patience and hard work, I was able to become a full-stack developer. I am sure my experience as a tutor and my knowledge of software engineering will be of great match to work as a curriculum developer at CodeHS.

Thorn:><`I felt satisfied when my students and clients were able to return to work while I worked as a tutor at a community college and a rehab center. As a developer, I was always looking for a job where I could use my skills and abilities for a mission that will make a healthy and peaceful society, and Thorn is found to line up what I was looking for. It was beyond anyone's thinking that the cases of child sexual abuse would increase to this level with the progress of the internet. Now, Thorn is the 'hero' that is working to stop the disgusting and unbearable crime using the same technology of the internet. As a matter of fact, the internet can be converted into a weapon to destroy the evils as it has great power. I know any knowledge can be used in two different ways in society, negative and positive. It will be just a true joy for me to be associated with Thorn working a positive way for the welfare of society if given a chance to work as a developer and use my skills to destroy evils.`
